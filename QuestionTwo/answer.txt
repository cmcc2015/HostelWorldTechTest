// NEW string OBJECT is created as opposed to literal "hostleworld" - nothing wrong as yet
String wordToCheck = new String(name);

// To compound this an object evaluator of == is applied to check if this STRING object
// with unique underlying hash (regardless of data(string spelling inside)) is == to
// the object created 'on the fly' by java of literal string "hostleworld" (regardless of spelling)
// This would always eval to false therefore hitting into the recursively calling fixSpelling inside
// in the else block
if(wordToCheck == "hostleworld" ) {

Solution:
evaluate the two with .equals method
